Tent, portable shelter, consisting of a rigid framework covered by some flexible substance.

            Tents are by far the most reliable and comfortable option for camping high in the mountains. However, their superior protection comes with a significant weight penalty. Despite this, tents are pretty much mandatory while alpine climbing and whenever heading into terrain that is unknown where cold weather could be a real problem. To cut down on excess weight, most climbers choose a single wall, 4-season tent.

The benefits of a tent are enticing. Entering a small bubble of warmth can definitely take the edge off during stressful situations. It’s also crucial for safety if you get stuck exposed in a big storm.

Consider that you may also need to climb with or haul the tent, find an appropriate spot to set it up, and also potentially dig out snow for this shelter to work. If it’s possible, a very popular and safe method is setting your tent up and sleeping at the base of your climb, leaving it up during the day and then returning to it as night approaches. Just make sure you start making appropriate decisions as dusk approaches, and understand when you may need to start the rappel back to shelter!

            A mountain hut is a building located high in the mountains, generally accessible only by foot, intended to provide food and shelter to mountaineers, climbers and hikers. Mountain huts are usually operated by an Alpine Club or some organization dedicated to hiking or mountain recreation. They are known by many names, including alpine hut, mountain shelter, mountain refuge, mountain lodge, and mountain hostel. It may also be called a refuge hut, although these occur in lowland areas (e.g. lowland forests) too.

Mountain huts can provide a range of services, starting with shelter and simple sleeping berths. Some, particularly in remote areas, are not staffed, but others have staff which prepare meals and drinks and can provide other services, including providing lectures and selling clothing and small items. Mountain huts usually allow anybody to access their facilities, although some require reservations.
<h5>Alphs</h5>
The construction of refuges and shelters in the Alps date back to ancient times, when Roman roads led across the mountain passes. In the High Middle Ages, hospitales were erected along the trade routes; cottages and sheds on the high mountain pastures served for Alpine transhumance. The long history of mountaineering from the 19th century onwards has led to a large number of Alpine club huts as well as private huts along the mountaineering paths. These huts are categorised according to their location and facilities.

                Everest Base Camp is either one of two base camps on either side of Mount Everest. South Base Camp is located in Nepal at an altitude of 5,364m and North Base Camp is at 5,5150m in Tibet. These camps are primarily used by mountaineers to ascend and descend the World's highest mountain. Mount Everest and Everest Base Camp are in roughly the same place geographically speaking, of course - the gorgeous Himalayas. But Everest Base Camp, being a base camp and all, is at the opposite end of the mountain to the 8,848m summit. It's at the (slightly) more manageable altitude of 5,380m above sea level.

                The term “bivouac” comes from the French military, meaning “night watch.” The term “bivouac” traces back to the French military. Derived from the Swiss-German term “bi-wacht,” it roughly translates to “night watch”. Hikers and climbers gradually adopted it to describe camping situations without the normal comforts of a family camping trip.

                Although buying a bivy sack (a mummy-shaped waterproof bag to put over your sleeping bag) is possible, most climbers use the term as a disambiguation to refer to various overnight sleeping scenarios. The best type of bivy for any given trip will be dictated by the terrain, weather, and planned trip length. For a summer bivy in good weather, you might be perfectly comfortable laying out the rope as an improvised sleeping pad on a sheltered ledge and using a puffy belay parka to keep out the cold.

                During harsh winter conditions and in the snow, there’s no real substitute for a four-season single-wall tent, down sleeping bags, and an insulated sleeping pad for every member of the party.

                    If you’re planning a big wall climb, chances are you will need a portaledge for the night. A portaledge is a portable platform, similar to a tent, with a metal frame and fabric cover that climbers secure to anchors on big walls. It’s literally vertical camping: the portaledge hangs in the air, which can feel a bit scary. However, it’s quite safe as each climber wears their harness and is secured independently to an anchor on the wall.

                    A snow cave is a shelter constructed from snow by certain animals in the wild, human mountain climbers, winter recreational enthusiasts, and winter survivalists. It has thermal properties similar to an igloo and is particularly effective at providing protection from wind as well as low temperatures. A properly made snow cave can be 0 °C (32 °F) or warmer inside, even when outside temperatures are −40 °C.
                    <h5>Construction</h5>
                     A snow cave is constructed by excavating snow so that the tunnel entrance is below the main space to retain warm air. Construction is simplified by building it on a steep slope and digging slightly upwards and horizontally into the slope. The roof is domed to prevent dripping on the occupants. Adequate snow depth, free of rocks and ice, is needed —generally, a depth of 4 to 5 feet (1.2 to 1.5 m) is sufficient. When constructing a snow cave is it common to build it in a large snow drift formed behind a ridge line, as this often offers a large heap of snow, and also protects the entrance of the snow cave from the prevailing wind. It is helpful to start digging a snow cave a bit up in the slope, as this allows easy disposal of the large volume of snow dug out when creating the cave. Another kind of snow cave is the quinzhee, which is constructed of piled and packed snow rather than created by digging a hole out of (or displacing) snow.
